# SNPDB

SNPDB is somewhat the base app of VariantGrid when it comes to genetics.

In theory library is a bunch of generic utilities, whereas snpdb includes base models required for any genetic based software.
It contains fundamental models such as Variant and Allele.

(SNP-DB was the original name for VariantGrid, thus the name)
