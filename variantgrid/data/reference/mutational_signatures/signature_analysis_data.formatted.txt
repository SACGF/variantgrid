[Signature 1]
Cancer types = Found in all cancer types and in most cancer samples.
Proposed aetiology = Result of an endogenous mutational process initiated by spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine.
Additional mutational features = Associated with small numbers of small insertions and deletions in most tissue types.
Comments = Correlates with age of cancer diagnosis.


[Signature 2]
Cancer types = Found in 22 cancer types, but most commonly in cervical and bladder cancers. In most of these 22 cancer types, Signature 2 is present in at least 10% of samples.
Proposed aetiology = Attributed to activity of the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases. On the basis of similarities in the sequence context of cytosine mutations caused by APOBEC enzymes in experimental systems, a role for APOBEC1, APOBEC3A and/or APOBEC3B in human cancer appears more likely than for other members of the family.
Additional mutational features = Transcriptional strand bias of mutations has been observed in exons, but is not present or is weaker in introns.
Comments = Usually found in the same samples as Signature 13. It has been proposed that activation of AID/APOBEC cytidine deaminases is due to viral infection, retrotransposon jumping or to tissue inflammation. Currently, there is limited evidence to support these hypotheses. A germline deletion polymorphism involving APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B is associated with the presence of large numbers of Signature 2 and 13 mutations and with predisposition to breast cancer. Mutations of similar patterns to Signatures 2 and 13 are commonly found in the phenomenon of local hypermutation present in some cancers, known as kataegis, potentially implicating AID/APOBEC enzymes in this process as well.


[Signature 3]
Cancer types = Found in breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers.
Proposed aetiology = Associated with failure of DNA double-strand break-repair by homologous recombination.
Additional mutational features = Associates strongly with elevated numbers of large (longer than 3bp) insertions and deletions with overlapping microhomology at breakpoint junctions.
Comments = Strongly associated with germline and somatic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in breast, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers. In pancreatic cancer, responders to platinum therapy usually exhibit Signature 3 mutations.


[Signature 4]
Cancer types = Found in head and neck cancer, liver cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, and oesophageal cancer.
Proposed aetiology = Associated with smoking and its profile is similar to the mutational pattern observed in experimental systems exposed to tobacco carcinogens (e.g., benzo[a]pyrene). Signature 4 is likely due to tobacco mutagens.
Additional mutational features = Exhibits transcriptional strand bias for C>A mutations, compatible with the notion that damage to guanine is repaired by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. Signature 4 is also associated with CC>AA dinucleotide substitutions.

Cancer types = Found predominantly in skin cancers and in cancers of the lip categorized as head and neck or oral squamous cancers.
Proposed aetiology = Based on its prevalence in ultraviolet exposed areas and the similarity of the mutational pattern to that observed in experimental systems exposed to ultraviolet light Signature 7 is likely due to ultraviolet light exposure.
Additional mutational features = Associated with large numbers of CC>TT dinucleotide mutations at dipyrimidines. Additionally, Signature 7 exhibits a strong transcriptional strand-bias indicating that mutations occur at pyrimidines (viz., by formation of pyrimidine-pyrimidine photodimers) and these mutations are being repaired by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair.
Comments = N/A


[Signature 8]
Cancer types = Found in breast cancer and medulloblastoma.
Proposed aetiology = unknown
Additional mutational features = Exhibits weak strand bias for C>A substitutions and is associated with double nucleotide substitutions, notably CC>AA.

[Signature 9]

Additional mutational features = N/A
Comments = Chronic lymphocytic leukaemias that possess immunoglobulin gene hypermutation (IGHV-mutated) have elevated numbers of mutations attributed to Signature 9 compared to those that do not have immunoglobulin gene hypermutation.


[Signature 10]
Cancer types = Found in six cancer types, notably colorectal and uterine cancer, usually generating huge numbers of mutations in small subsets of samples.
Proposed aetiology = It has been proposed that the mutational process underlying this signature is altered activity of the error-prone polymerase POLE. The presence of large numbers of Signature 10 mutations is associated with recurrent POLE somatic mutations, viz., Pro286Arg and Val411Leu.
Additional mutational features = Exhibits strand bias for C>A mutations at TpCpT context and T>G mutations at TpTpT context.

Proposed aetiology = unknown
Additional mutational features = Exhibits a strong transcriptional strand-bias for T>C substitutions.
Comments = Usually contributes a small percentage (<20%) of the mutations observed in a liver cancer sample.


[Signature 13]
Cancer types = Found in 22 cancer types and seems to be commonest in cervical and bladder cancers. In most of these 22 cancer types, Signature 13 is present in at least 10% of samples.
Proposed aetiology = Attributed to activity of the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases converting cytosine to uracil. On the basis of similarities in the sequence context of cytosine mutations caused by APOBEC enzymes in experimental systems, a role for APOBEC1, APOBEC3A and/or APOBEC3B in human cancer appears more likely than for other members of the family. Signature 13 causes predominantly C>G mutations. This may be due to generation of abasic sites after removal of uracil by base excision repair and replication over these abasic sites by REV1.
Additional mutational features = Transcriptional strand bias of mutations has been observed in exons, but is not present or is weaker in introns.
Comments = Usually found in the same samples as Signature 13. It has been proposed that activation of AID/APOBEC cytidine deaminases is due to viral infection, retrotransposon jumping or to tissue inflammation. Currently, there is limited evidence to support these hypotheses. A germline deletion polymorphism involving APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B is associated with the presence of large numbers of Signature 2 and 13 mutations and with predisposition to breast cancer. Mutations of similar patterns to Signatures 2 and 13 are commonly found in the phenomenon of local hypermutation present in some cancers, known as kataegis, potentially implicating AID/APOBEC enzymes in this process as well.
