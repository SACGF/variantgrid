<p>
Variant may overlap different transcripts, where they can have different codons, exons or domains.
</p>

<p>
    When looking for overlaps, we use <b>all transcripts for both this and other variants</b>. Details are shown in the "method" sections.
</p>

<p>
The grids only show the representative transcript for each variant, and so it may appear that the codon/exon/domain in the grid does not match the criteria. This is because the variant has a match against a transcript that is not shown on the grid.
</p>

<p>
To see the transcript that met the criteria, you may need to open the variant details page ("view details" button in the 1st column) where you can see annotations for each transcript that overlapped with the variant.
