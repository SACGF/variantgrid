<p>
When reassigning stable identifiers between reannotation we can optionally choose to increment the version number assigned with a stable identifier. We do so to indicate an underlying change in the entity. The rules for incrementing the version depends on the entity in question and detailed below:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Genes:</b> increments when the set of transcripts linked to a gene changes
    <li><b>Transcripts:</b> increments when there is a change in a transcript's splicing pattern, chromsome location or a sequence change in the cDNA
</ul>
