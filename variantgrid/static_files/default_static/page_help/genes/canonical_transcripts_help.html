Many genes have multiple transcripts, but people want only one value for each gene.

This is achieved by choosing a single (representative or canonical) transcript, and use that transcripts value for the gene.

A CanonicalTranscriptCollection is a list of gene:transcript mappings imported into the system.

The administrator can import different collections, linking them to EnrichmentKits and setting a system default.
