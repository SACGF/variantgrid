You CANNOT rename a pathology test - the name is a fundamental part of a test and we need to be able to find any historical orders.

Instead of renaming a test, create a new test by copying genes from the old one, then delete the old test. Steps:

<ul>
<li> Click <kbd>[manage tests]</kbd> on the left menu
<li> Click <kbd>[new pathology test]</kbd>
<li> Enter the new name, select the old test to copy from then click <kbd>[create]</kbd>.
</ul>

This will create a new test based on the old one.
You can then delete the old test, by going to the test page and clicking the <kbd>[Delete...]</kbd> link.
