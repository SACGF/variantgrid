<p>
Analysis templates are pre-configured analyses that can be configured then run on new data (eg a Sample or Trio)
</p>

<p>
Templates are created like normal anaylses, then fields in the node editor are configured as "Analysis Variables" which means they will be set from new data when they are run.

Currently, only Sample/Trio/Cohort works as Analysis Variables.
</p>

<p>
When a template is run and samples are changed, some downstream nodes may also change (eg a GeneListNode configured to use a sample gene list, or PhenotypeNode using patient phenotypes)
</p>

<p>
Note on <b>Genome Build</b> - An analysis templates is created for a particular genome build but can be run with data from any build.

This will be fine if anything build specific was set as an Analysis Variable so is changed, but will fail if for example, a node was hardcoded to have build specific data (eg an IntersectionsNode with a hardcoded bed file)

We run a check after running the template / populating data to make sure that all nodes use data from the same build.
