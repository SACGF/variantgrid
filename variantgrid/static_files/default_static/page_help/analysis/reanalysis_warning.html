    Please be aware that re-analysis of existing sequencing data may reveal previously unreported
    pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Such findings may obligate you to perform a review, issue
    an amended report, and notify the referring clinician in accordance with laboratory policy and
    regulatory requirements. It is recommended that you perform these queries with limits on the
    number of results returned.
