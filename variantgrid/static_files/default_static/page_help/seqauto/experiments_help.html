<p>
Experiments are codes used to match patient and wetlab details with sequencing runs.

<p>
The grid below shows codes created from:
<ul>
<li><b>SequencingRun</b> Read from an XML file in the flowcell directory.
</ul>

<p>
An experiment may be sequenced multiple times (technical replicates). In this case there will be multiple entries in the SequencingRuns column.
A SequencingRun can only have one experiment.

<h4>Name Matching</h4>
<p>
Experiment names are automatically cleaned (UPPERCASED, spaces and dashes converted to underscore, "rpt" removed from the end so replicates match).

<p>
The cleaned names must match to link everything correctly.

To modify a SequencingRun, click the experiment tab on a run and follow the instructions.
