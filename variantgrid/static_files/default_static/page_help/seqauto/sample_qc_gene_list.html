"Matched Gene Symbol" shows the genes which have the same gene symbol as "Name" (there may be multiple).
If the column is blank, nothing matched and your symbol is not being used in the filter.

<p>
VariantGrid uses Ensembl for genes, and so we have to convert RefSeq transcript to gene names.
In that case, there will also be a column called "Uploaded Name" which shows what was in the file before using UCSC aliases to convert to Ensembl gene symbols
