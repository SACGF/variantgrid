An AnnotationVersion is composed of 4 sub types: Variant Level, Gene level, ClinVar and Human Protein Atlas.

<p>
They are updated by someone manually changing pipelines or updating annotation files on the server.

<p>
Each of these tools can be upgraded separately, changing one will create a new master AnnotationVersion which is used to version analyses and diagnoses.

<P>
This allows you to keep track of past annotations, as well as compare results from new annotations vs old.
