<p>
Variant Annotation Runs track the pipelines on the server to annotate variants.

<p>
VariantGrid stores each variant once, but multiple versions of annotation per variant. See <a href="/annotation/annotation_versions">annotation version.</a> for these versions.

<p>
AnnotationRuns are created automatically whenever VCFs with previously unknown variants are uploaded.

<p>
The annotation run dumps new variants to the server, runs them through the pipeline and re-uploads the data.
