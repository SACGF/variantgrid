<p>
Custom Columns are used to select <a href="javascript:open_annotation_descriptions()">annotations</a> and set their order in analysis grids.

<p>
    Each analysis has it's own columns, which you can change via analysis settings (<img src="/static/icons/settings-icon.png" alt="cog icon"/>).
</p>

<p>
    Analyses are created with columns set to your default columns, which you can change on the <a href="javascript:open_user_settings()">User Settings page</a>
</p>

You can't edit built-in custom columns, as they are shared by everyone. Click a "Clone..." link below to make and edit your own copy.
