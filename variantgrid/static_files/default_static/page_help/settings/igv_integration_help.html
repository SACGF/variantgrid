Bam files are often on a shared drive such as <code>/data/bams/sample1.bam</code>, which may be accessed differently across workstations.

For this reason, we allow users to alter the prefix of BAM files before sending them to IGV.

<p>
<b>Example:</b>
<p>
Alice's lab uses a web server that shares the server's <code>/data/bams</code> directory as <code>http://igv-server:8080/bams</code>.

<p>
Bob uses Windows file sharing. He could either replace <code>/data</code> with <code>\\server-name\data</code> or map it to his <code>E:/</code> drive and use that.
