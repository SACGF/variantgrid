GenomicIntervals file comes from uploading a <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1">Bed File</a>,
which is flattened and merged (overlapping intervals are combined) using BedTools.

<h4>Genome Build</h4>

We attempt to automatically detect the genome build via:

<ul>
    <li>track header line, contains a recognised build name or alias in the "db", "genome", "genome_build" or "genomeBuild" fields</li>
    <li>detect from filename (contains ONLY ONE recognised build name or alias in the filename, eg "intervals_grch37.bed")</li>
    <li>If the user only has 1 genome build in their User Settings</li>
</ul>
