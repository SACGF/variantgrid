Automatically flag classification candidates for human review

The two searches you can kick off are:

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Cross Sample Classification</b> - Classifications are performed against a VCF sample. Look for other samples that have the variant, but not the classification.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Classification Evidence Update</b> - Look for new evidence (from annotation sources like gnomAD, ClinVar, new tools) that has arrived since a classification was made
    </li>
</ul>
