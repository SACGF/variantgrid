    The import page is to help power users understand how the import API works for creating automated uploads. It is not intended for general use.<br/>
    You can use the form to provide an example record, and then see at the bottom left what JSON that maps to.<br/>
    Clicking the Run button uploads the data to the server and shows the response.<br/>
    If test mode and delete were off, after you Run a link to the newly created (or just updated) record will appear.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Test Mode</b> The test mode checkbox means whatever you do will not have an effect on the database.
    Note that some of the return codes will be different when you do this, e.g. the id will be null instead of a valid value.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Lab</b> Which lab is this record uploaded as, selection will be limited to the ones the current user is associated with.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Lab Record ID</b> The id to be associated to this record, should be unique within the lab for new records, or the same
    as an existing record for an update.<br/>
    It will default to a new ID on page load, but won't change automatically after that.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Delete</b> If checked the delete flag will be sent up, should not be sent up on new record ids.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Publish Level</b> What share level this data should be sent up as. Note this will only take effect if there are
    no validation errors.
</p>
<p>
    <b>c.hgvs</b> & <b>genome build</b> The basic details for matching a coordinate. Note that the API does allow for
    variant coordinate instead of c.hgvs, but c.hgvs is preferred.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Clinical Significance</b>, <b>Zygosity</b> Mandatory fields for a record - will only accept certain values.
</p>
<p>
    <b>key x</b>, <b>value x</b> For providing values for any key found in the list of evidence keys.<br/>
    e.g.
<span style="font-family:monospace">
    <span style="display:inline-block;padding:4px;border:1px solid gray;border-radius:2px">gene_symbol</span>&nbsp;
    <span style="display:inline-block;padding:4px;border:1px solid gray;border-radius:2px">PTEN</span></span><br/>
    All values will be sent up as strings, though the API will automatically convert strings to numbers, booleans and lists
    when appropriate.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Extra Data</b> there is a text field for appending arbitrary JSON to the request.<br/>
    This will allow you to upload extra bits of data such as notes and explain, e.g.<br/>
    <pre style="font-family:monospace;white-space:pre-wrap">{
    "allele_origin": {
        "value":"germline",
        "note":"I think this is germline",
        "explain":"Our lab uses the following criteria to determine allele_origin"
    },
    "gnomad_af": 0.0002
}</pre>
