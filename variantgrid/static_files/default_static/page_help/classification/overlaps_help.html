<p>
    This page shows alleles that have two or more classifications associated with them - where at least one of the classifications belongs to a lab you are part of.
</p>
<p>
    This page can be a useful tool see how your lab has classified a variant in comparison to another lab/s or to detect duplicate entries from your lab.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    Two (or more) classifications are considered discordant if they meet all of the following criteria:
    <ul>
        <li>Belong to the same allele</li>
        <li>Belong to the same clinical group within that allele (including the “default” clinical group)</li>
        <li>Are shared at the Shariant Users level or 3rd Party Database level</li>
        <li>Have clinical significances that fall into two or more of the following buckets:
            <ul>
                <li>Benign/Likely Benign</li>
                <li>VUS (A/B/C)</li>
                <li>Likely Pathogenic/Pathogenic</li>
                <li>Risk Factor</li>
            </ul>
            e.g. Likely Benign is discordant with VUS, but Likely Benign is concordant with Benign.</li>
    </ul>
