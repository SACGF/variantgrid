Be aware of transcript choice. Usually the most deleterious transcript is chosen for curation, however, it is also important to investigate relevant tissue-specific expression and understand is the canonical transcript and whether this is the same transcript that has been previously used for curation.

<ul>
    <li><b>Representative</b> - transcript chosen for this variant (via <a href="https://asia.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/script/vep_other.html#pick">VEP pick</a>) - this is what is used in an analysis and shown in the grid.
    <li><b>Canonical</b> - transcript for gene, chosen by annotation provider (RefSeq/Ensembl)
</ul>
