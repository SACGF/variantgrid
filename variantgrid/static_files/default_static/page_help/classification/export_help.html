<p>
Configure the parameters here to generate a re-usable export URL that can be periodically called to download shared classifications.<br/>
If you wish to download a few classifications for personal reviewing, you may be better served by the download links on the 
<a href="/classification/classifications" class="hover-link">classifications page</a>.
</p>
<p>
    If you are going to copy the URL in your browser to download periodically, choose "Web Browser".<br/>
    If this is for copying into some a program that will automatically download, choose "API".
</p>
<p>
The following classifications will not be downloaded (except when using the CSV format)<br/>
<ul>
    <li>Classifications that are matching or failed to match a variant
    <li>Classifications with outstanding matching warning or transcript version flags
    <li>Classifications attached to variants that have liftover warning flags (if the liftover warning is for the same transcript as the classification)
    <li>Classifications that could not be lifted over to the desired genome build</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Pick a genome build, regardless of which build the classification was uploaded as it will be lifted over to your desired build.
</p>
<p>
You can choose to exclude entire organisations, or only certain labs within an organisation. If you are uploading classifications to this
environment and only wish to download other labs classifications, these options will let you do that.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Lastly, choose a file format that your system can easily handle<br/>
Some formats will contain only a summary of data e.g. MVL and VCF<br/>
Some formats will have one record per classification e.g. CSV, JSON while others might group on variant/transcript e.g. MVL<br/>
