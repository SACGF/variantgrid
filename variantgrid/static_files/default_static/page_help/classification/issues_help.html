<p>
    This page will list all classifications belonging to your lab/s that have flags raised against them.<br/>
    Each classification flag indicates that there is an action that needs to be performed against the classification.<br/>
    Clicking on each flag will give you instructions on what needs to be done to resolve it.
</p>
<p>
    Flags range from issues with variant matching, to discordances or suggestions.<br/>
    You can filter by the flag categories below:
</p>
<p>
    <b>Have any issue</b>: All classifications with flags requiring action will be shown.
</p>
<p><b>Requires discussion</b>: Shows classifications in discordance, where a user has raised a suggestion or if a clinical
    significance change has occurred.</p>

<p>
    <b>Requires a data fix</b>: The classification is missing mandatory fields, has not been shared with Shariant users, has
    unshared edits or has an outstanding warning/error regarding variant matching.<br/>
    This will most likely require a technical representative from your lab to fix.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Have been withdrawn</b>: Here you can view classifications from your lab that have been withdrawn.
    No action is required here.
