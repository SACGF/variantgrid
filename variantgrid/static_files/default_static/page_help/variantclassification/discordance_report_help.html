<h3>What is Discordance?</h3>
<p>A discordance is reported when two or more classifications for the same allele fall into two of the following categories:
<ul>
<li>Benign, Likely Benign</li>
    <li>VUS</li>
    <li>Likely Pathogenic, Pathogenic</li>
    </ul>
For example, Benign and Likely Benign are considered concordant, whereas VUS and Likely Pathogenic are considered discordant.
</p>

<h3>The Basics</h3>
<p>
The desired end goal is for the labs to reach concordance via one or more labs changing the clinical significance of their variant interpretation.

    <b>Flags</b> - You can raise flags against your own classification or others by clicking the gear icon next to them. This helps to facilitate communication and allows us to track the discordance process.
</p>

<h3>Quick Steps to Concordance</h3>
<p>
    <b>Internal Review</b> - Perform an internal review of your lab's classification/s. If you determine that you need to change any of your data, please do so in your interpretation system and the changes will be reflected in Shariant when they sync next. If the review will take some time, you can raise an Internal Review flag to indicate that the review is taking place.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Discordance Discussion</b> - Compare your classification with those from other labs using the Show Diffs button.<br/>
Review any outstanding suggestions against your lab's classification. Raise the suggestion flag on other classifications if you believe that evidence from other labs requires discussion.
</p>
<h3>Other Resolutions</h3>
<p>
A discordance report can also be closed when one of the following happen.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Clinical Re-Groupings</b> - Classifications for a single allele can be separated into different groupings if appropriate, e.g. if the the condition or transcript are significantly different that the interpretations can be considered separate rather than contradictory.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Continued Discordance</b> - This can be raised if the labs cannot agree on how to reach concordance. By selecting this option, the discordance report will be closed until new information is available.
