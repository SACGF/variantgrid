<h3>Missing annotation</h3>

<p>Structural Variants are missing some normal annotation:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Sequence and domains</li>
    <li>Pathogenicity</li>
    <li>Conservation</li>
    <li>Splicing</li>
    <li>Non-gnomAD population frequency</li>
    <li>COSMIC</li>
    <li>MAVEdb</li>
</ul>

We hope to be able to add some of this in the future.

<h3>gnomAD</h3>

We report overlaps against gnomAD Structural Variants that:

<ul>
    <li>Overlap >= 80% with our SV
    <li>Have no FILTERS (there were too many extremely large artifacts that overlapped with everything)
    <li>Have the same "type" (ie del for a del, inv for an inv)
</ul>

<p>
You can view all overlaps by selecting "Show Structural Variant Overlaps"
</p>

<p>
If there are multiple overlapping gnomAD records, we assign the one with the lowest allele frequency to the gnomAD values (gnomad_af, allele count) etc - it is this which will be used for filtering in an analysis.
