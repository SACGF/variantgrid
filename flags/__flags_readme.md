# Flags

Flags were designed as a way to be able to add a "flag" to any other model - where the flag has the properties of:
* Type
* Comments
* Resolution

Along with the date the flag was raised and closed.

This gives us a lot of flexibility to quickly add flag types, but the amount of functionality you can extract from flags is limited.
As such we have slowly moved away from flags for new development, but there are still use cases.
