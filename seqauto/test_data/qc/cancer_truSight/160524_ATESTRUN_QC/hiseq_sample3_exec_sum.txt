# Description of terms:
#
# All ranges are from the 5th to the 95th percentile
# Mean coverage across GOI: ref range for GOI (per sample) only. Defaults to longest transcript if not specified
# All regions targetted by the vendor are used to derive mean coverage across kit & % of bases with >20x coverage across kit
# For the Roche Nimblegen kits, these correspond to the intervals specified in the empirical bed file for Hg19
# Uniformity of Coverage: % of bases at at least 20% of the mean depth
# Read enrichment (%): reads on target
# Duplicated alignable reads: PCR duplicated reads
# Median insert: distance between read pairs
# Ts/Tv: transition/transversion - 3 is ideal
